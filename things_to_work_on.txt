call main script
    present options
        run network IOS XE stig in check mode
            ask to run in check mode or apply mode
            run ansible playbook with specific ansible.cfg that uses stig call back script
            run xccdf network parser script to make docs and config for unapplied stigs
            set environment variables for stig and export
        run network IOS XE STIG in apply mode
            run ansible playbook with specific ansible.cfg that uses stig call back script
            run xccdf network parser script to make docs and config for unapplied stigs
            set environment variables for stig and export
        generate IOS XE STIG config 
            use a menu system to put in hostname and other options
                IOS xe still needs the ability to read a file and make a config
                add in username and password as well
        run parsers
            IOS XE currently
        grow this as more options are added
        




would like to have
    dockerfile that runs all this in a virtual environment
        have the file but not exactly working yet.  Working on python first then that.
    webpage with buttons to control all this
    ability to generate an inventory file from webpage input
